Dennis Gabor (1900-1979) was Hungarian electrical engineer and physicst. He is most known for inventing holography, for which
he won Nobel Prize in 1971. Among many other achievements he proposed so called Gabor filter , which will be subject of discussion
in current post.

From mathematical point of view filter is obtained by mulitpling sinusoid by Gaussian function (<i>j</i> represtens imaginary unit). 

import Latex from '../../components/Latex.astro'

<Latex formula='g(x,y) = e^{j2 \pi fx_0} \times e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x_{\theta}^2}{\sigma_x^2} + \frac{x_{\theta}^2}{\sigma_y^2} \right)}'/>

The coordinates x and y are rotated in the xy plane by <i>theta</i> angle. They can be obtained ussing following formula:
<Latex formula={`
    \\begin{aligned} 
    x_\\theta &= &xcos_\\theta + ysin_\\theta \\\\ 
    y_\\theta &= - &xsin_\\theta + ycos\\theta \\end{aligned}
    `}

That's all what I planned for today. In next posts you will find information how to use Gabor filters to 
realize certain image processing algorithms. Btw. if you've noticed that equation are not written in standard HTML way, I'll suggest you to read about [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), which is 
web wrapper for [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org).
