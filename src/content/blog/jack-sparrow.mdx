Hello and welcome! It's great to see you after these few months of my inactivity. The recent time has been quite 
demanding for me as I changed employers, and the initial period at a new job is always intense, so I havenâ€™t had 
much time for blogging. Today, Iâ€™d like to use this article as a form of self-promotion :)

Some time ago, I created and published a compass component (which I named [maplibre-compass-pro](https://github.com/jedluk/maplibre-compass-pro)), 
fully compatible with the [MapLibre GL](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) library. In this article, Iâ€™d 
like to introduce you to its API and also show how it looks in a real application.

But first, let me explain my motivation for creating it. On one gloomy autumn evening (autumn is really gloomy in Poland), 
I watched Pirates of the Caribbean once again. As you probably know, one of Jack Sparrow's main attributes is his [compass](https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Jack_Sparrow%27s_compass), 
which always points the way to his goal. Since I was working intensively on a map-based application at the time, I began t
o wonder if there was a library with an advanced compass in a classic style, similar to the one from the movie. By default, 
MapLibre applications offer a compass feature, but itâ€™s a very basic version and lacks anything exciting.
