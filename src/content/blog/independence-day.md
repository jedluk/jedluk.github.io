On November 11, 1918, with the end of World War I, Poland regained its independence after 123 years. The dark chapter in the history of my country took place in the second half of the 18th century when the state, torn apart by internal conflicts, was absorbed by its neighbors: Prussia, Austria, and Russia.
The Partitions occurred in the years 1772, 1792, and 1795. 

The hero image you can see above is one of the most known polish buildings - Palace of Culture and Science. It was build right after II world war , as a 'gift' from Soviet Nation. From this reason it is known as most popular communism symbol in Poland (1945-1989). Communism passed away but building still stands.
