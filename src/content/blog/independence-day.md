On November 11, 1918, with the end of World War I, Poland regained its independence after 123 years. The darkest chapter in the history of my country took place in the second half of the 18th century when the state, torn apart by internal conflicts, was absorbed by its neighbors: Prussia, Austria, and Russia. The Partitions occurred in the years [1772](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Partition_of_Poland), [1792](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Partition_of_Poland) and [1795](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Partition_of_Poland).

Today, I won't talk about technology. Today is a time for reflection. Reflection on our history. Who you are and where you come from is a result of events from the past. That's why I invite you on a short journey through the history of my country. I've chosen 5 historical figures and 5 events that will bring you closer to the history of my country.

Last but not least - hero image. It's another sign of history, the current one. Depicted building (vector version) is the [Palace of Culture and Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Culture_and_Science) (located in the capital of Poland - Warsaw). It was build right after II world war , as a 'gift' from Soviet Nation. From this reason it is known as popular communism symbol in Poland (1945-1989). The political situation may change, but our identity stays with us forever - just as it was with the Poles during the 123 years of partitions and helped in the rebirth of the Polish state.
