The year 2023 is coming to an end. It's a good moment to summarize what has happened and discuss plans for the coming year.

First of all I want to say that it was good year, cause I learned more than I expected. Some topics are still delayed for undetermined future (like Rust and WASM), some others appeared¬†unexpectedly (Astro). Below you can find a list of technology & tools I learn / discovered in current year.

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe" target="_blank">tippecanoe</a>, industry standard tool for creating vector tiles. By digging into the topic I discovered company called <a href="https://felt.com/">Felt</a> (where tippecanoe inventor,  Erica Fisher,  is hired) whose goal is to move GIS into web. Well done! Felt is maintaining up-to-date <a href="https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe/" target="_blank">tippecanoe</a> version, </li>
    <li><a href="https://clickhouse.com/" target="_blank">Clickhouse</a>, probably fastest OLAP database. If you need storage for massive amount of immutable data, you should use it now!,</li>
    <li><a href="https://gdal.org/index.html">GDAL- Geospatial Data Abstraction Library</a>. It helps a lot with conversion between different geospatial formats. Check how to build global temperature map with GDAL <a href="/blog/what-is-the-weather/">here</a>,</li>
    <li>I bought Raspberry Pi 4B. What a fun! After a years I learn how to do extra moves in Mortal Kombat 3. Priceless. Read more about setting up your own retro pie <a href="/blog/mario-is-back/" target="_blank">here</a>,</li>
    <li>finally I found some time to learn Next13. I used YouTube for learning , and specifically I watched & implemented 2 projects: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aeMRB8LL4o&ab_channel=CodeWithAntonio" target="_blank">Spotify clone</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGPGcKBpAk8&ab_channel=CodeWithAntonio" target="_blank">Messenger clone</a>. Thank you Antonio for releasing this course üôè,</li>
    <li>last but not least I met <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a>, which helps me to drive this blog. It hasn't let me down so far. I still need to catch up on Astro 4 features, </li>
    <li>I had occasion to develop Android based application (at my workplace). We are using Java, and for me it was come back after 6 years of not using it at all. What can I say üòÖ I know languages where you can express your ideas in smarter way</li>
    <li>I've started to use ChatGPT on my daily basis. It's tough collaboration, but if you're patience enough then the results outweigh the disadvantages,</li>
</ul>

My plans for 2024 are:

<ul>
    <li>learn WebGL2. Probably this is <a href="https://webgl2fundamentals.org/" target="_blank">good place to start</a>. WebGL will help me to create custom map layers, which can be extraordinary. Example wind layer created in <a href="https://philogb.github.io/page/wind/" target="_blank">deckGL environment</a> with webGL usage,</li>
    <li>I won't escape from learning Android. It's not my desired technologoy but if you work in start-up environment sometimes you have to sarcriface your plans for greater good. Maybe I'll touch a base with Kotlin as well,</li>
    <li>continue to learn Next.js 13+ (version 13 is practically new framework, just like AngularJS and Angular 2+). I've already enrolled for a course , lead by 2 smart guys. Maybe I'll attend NextJS conference in February as well, </li>
    <li>continute to learn Astro</li>
</ul>

Maybe it's not a very ambitious plan but it is achievable. I hope 2024 will be at least as creative as 2023 was. Wish You all the best 2024! See you in next year!
