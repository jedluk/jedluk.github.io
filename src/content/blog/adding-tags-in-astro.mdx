I'm still learning about [Astro](https://astro.build/) environment, but today I want to share with You how I approached adding 
tags to my blog.

All the posts are written with Markdown / MDX (markdown on steroids which allow to embeed JSX elements). Each such file 
has structured content, and by that, I mean:

<ul>
    <li>header</li>
    <li>actual post content</li>
</ul>

Example header looks like below:

```md

title: 'Introduction to OpenCV'
description: 'Applying basics image processing operations in OpenCV with Python'
pubDate: 'Sep 26 2023'
heroImage: '/blog/images/bambo_bin.jpg'
tags: ['python', 'openCV']
---
```

As you can suspect all those fields are later used on blog page, where all articles are listed. Also they match <i>schema</i> defined
in config located inside <i>content</i> dir.
```js
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content'

const blog = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.coerce.date(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()),
    updatedDate: z.coerce.date().optional(),
    heroImage: z.string().optional()
  })
})
```

Idea behind collecting tags is rather simple. First of all you have to know that Astro is static site builder.
It means it does a significant job during the build, generating HTML files which later, on runtime, are sent to a browser. It's opposite 
approach to SPA (Single Page Application), where entire application is bundled during the build and later, on runtime, sent to a client where DOM is 
dynamically build. Astro exposes API to enhance page content during the build. One of such functions is [getStaticPaths](https://docs.astro.build/pl/reference/api-reference/#getstaticpaths). 
This function works for dynamic pages only (those files which are surrounded by square brackets - like [page].astro). Function should return array of object which are pre-rendered by astro.
Also it allows to provide custom props for each page. It's perfect place to pass tags. As mentioned earlier procedure of generating tags is not complicated at all:
<ul>
  <li>all tags (from all articles) are extracted and transformed to lowercase (avoid duplication in case of case insensitive notation)</li>
  <li>tags are counted based on its name</li>
  <li>tags are sorted based on count and by name</li>
</ul> 

Function which takes collection of posts and returns array of tuples (name with tag count) is presented below.

```js
export function extractTags(post: CollectionEntry<'blog'>): string[] {
  return post.data.tags.map((tag) => tag.toLowerCase())
}

export function getTagsByCount(posts: CollectionEntry<'blog'>[]): [string, number][] {
  const tagsCountMap = posts
    .map(extractTags)
    .flat()
    .reduce(
      (acc, tag) => acc.set(tag, (acc.get(tag) ?? 0) + 1),
      new Map<string, number>()
    )

  return Array.from(tagsCountMap.entries()).sort(
    ([name1, count1], [name2, count2]) =>
      count1 === count2
        ? name1 > name2 ? 1 : -1
        : count2 > count1 ? 1 : -1
  )
}
```

This function operates on collection of posts. But it's still not clear where to get this. The previously mentioned functioin - <i>getStaticPaths</i> - comes to our aid.
Due to its async nature we are able to read entire collection first (built-in <i>getCollection</i> function). Our job is to transform all posts and return Astro-understable
objects. I'm doing following then:
<ul>
  <li>read all posts</li>
  <li>sort them by publication date (newest goes first)</li>
  <li>use built-in <i>paginate</i> function to slice all posts into chunks (each chunk will be rendered to different page:
  `/blog/1`, `/blog/2`, ...), based on provided size</li>
  <li>add additional props for each page (like tags)</li>
</ul>


```js
export async function getStaticPaths({
  paginate
}): Promise<Page<CollectionEntry<'blog'>>> {
  const posts = await getCollection('blog')
  const sortedPosts = posts.sort(
    (a, b) => b.data.pubDate.valueOf() - a.data.pubDate.valueOf()
  )
  return paginate(sortedPosts, {
    pageSize: PAGINATION_SIZE,
    props: {
      tags: getTagsByCount(sortedPosts)
    }
  })
}
```
Last but not least <i>tags</i> props is used when defining view. Please note I'm using Astro component, not React one (the way how we create 
them is similar, but component definition differs).
```jsx
<div
  class="flex justify-center items-start flex-wrap odd:items-end min-w-fit mx-4 mb-4 [&>span]:mb-1"
>
  {tags.map(([tag, count]) => <Tag selected name={tag} count={count} />)}
</div>
```

The result of above mentioned effort is visible [here](/blog/1), on top of the page. Also, each tag is interactive so after clicking on it
you'll be redirected to a dynamic page which contain filtered posts. Hint: it's also done with <i>getStaticPaths</i> function.

That's all I wanted to share today. As you could see, adding tags with Astro is a fairly simple task. Also, for some of you, the getStaticPath function may 
be associated with the Next.js (up to version 12). Even though these two frameworks are somewhat similar in some aspects, Astro focuses on its own architecture 
called Astro Island. Next.js, on the other hand, has moved towards Server-Side Components and server actions. It's yet another topic to blog, to compare both ðŸ˜… 

As the holidays are approaching rapidly, I would like to wish you and your loved ones a healthy, joyful, and family-filled celebration. May they be a time of relaxation and rejuvenation.

P.S. I have plan to release 2 posts until end of the year , so stay tuned!
