In current episode I'm going to continue to talk about maplibre and its features, also some new terms will be introduced. 
One more thing - you'll know what tram you should take to get to my neighborhood if you ever visit city where I live ðŸ¤£.
As always, I am a supporter of practice over theory, so you can expect interesting examples.

If you have read my series titled [Build you own planet with OSM](/blog/osm-intro-vol-1/) you should now already that vector tiles are 
core element for building modern web maps. But of course, there are several other ways to add data to the map. I'd like to discuss one of them with you - GeoJSON.
GeoJSON, based on the JSON format, allows for a straightforward representation of geographic features along with their non-spatial attributes. Its undeniable 
advantage is simplicity, readability, and ease of transfer between different environments. Following geometries can be described via GeoJSON: points, line strings, polygons and multi-part 
collections of these types. Example file including abovementiones geometries you can find below:

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [1.0, 2.0]
      },
      "properties": {
        "name": "bus stop"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "LineString",
        "coordinates": [
          [1.0, 0.0],
          [2.3, 1.0],
          [3.4, -1.0],
          [4.0, -2.0]
        ]
      },
      "properties": {
        "steetName": ""
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          [
            [10.0, 0.0],
            [11.0, 0.0],
            [11.0, 1.0],
            [10.0, 1.0],
            [10.0, 0.0]
          ]
        ]
      },
      "properties": {
        "name": "Neverland",
        "population": 100000
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
As you can see each feature contains 3 mandatory properties: `type` - constant string `feature`, `geometry` (always contains `type` and `coordinates`) 
and `properties` (JSON like object of non-spatial attributes). To understand multi-part geometries you should visit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON#Geometries) (they have nice visual examples), 
but basically it's nothing more like combining independent parts into single feature (e.g. it will allow to describe polygon with hole). Practical example of GeoJSON ? This is the website of [public transport in my city](https://www.zditm.szczecin.pl/en).
Next to timetables they expose map view for each bus/tram line. Tram number 8 is the most commonly used means of public transportation for me. Its timetable can be found [here](https://www.zditm.szczecin.pl/en/maps/line/8/8)
and map view [here](https://www.zditm.szczecin.pl/pl/mapy/linia/8/8). A little bit of sniffing in chrome developer console 
and we can see that they use GeoJSON for drawing route on a map. For reason I don't understand now (ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…) we have to use POST method for calling their API, instead usuall GET. Let's use curl then.
```sh
curl -X POST https://www.zditm.szczecin.pl/pl/passenger/maps/trajectories/8 -o tram8.json
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 84751  100 84751    0     0   417k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  424k
```
Now we can open `tram8.json` file in any code editor. They've used `LineString` to describe tram route, which seems to be a good choice. Additionally I can see 
2 non-spatial attributes, which are: <i>route_variant_number</i> and <i>route_variant_type</i>. For now its purpose is unknown for me. I'm keeping file for later use.

Now let's prepare some vector godies for our map. Because we are talking about city where I live (<a href="https://www.google.pl/maps/place/Szczecin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Szczecin</a>), 
I'm proposing following cropping area (left, top, right, bottom): `14.4,53.5,14.8,53.3`. For creating tiles I'm using [bash script](/blog/osm-planet/make-tiles.sh) I've prepared earlier. Let's run the script with following arguments:
```sh
./make-tiles.sh --bbox 14.4,53.5,14.8,53.3 --output szczecin --dump ./OSM/planet-230918.osm.pbf
```
Just a reminder: you have to pass all 3 options: <i>bbox, output</i> (file name without extension) and <i>dump</i> (location of Planet dump on your computer). 
After awhile we're getting `szczecin.mbtiles`. In normal circumstances we serve those tiles via tileserver-gl. But today we'll use different approach: `pmtiles`. It's pretty new standard 
for storing tiled data - single-file archieve which can be stored on a commodity storage, like S3. It makes our web apps "serveless" -  free of external 
tile backend (like tileserve-gl), which benefits in low-cost, zero-maintenance app. Project is driven by [Protomaps](https://docs.protomaps.com/pmtiles/). Conversion 
from <i>mbtiles</i> into <i>pmtiles</i> is extremely easy. First, I'm downloading go binary from [there](https://github.com/protomaps/go-pmtiles/releases).
Assuming binary is stored in same location as `mbtiles` we do the conversion:

```sh
pmtiles convert szczecin.mbtiles szczecin.pmtiles
```
I'm keeping `pmtiles` in git repository so that it can be hosted via gitub pages.
