Hi there! How you are doing ? I've just returned from first Next.js conference in Poland and it was sooooooo good! 
There are rumors that the event will permanently become a part of the Polish IT scene. And for sure I want to be a part of it next years!

The event took place in the majestic <a href="https://www.google.pl/maps/place/Kino+Luna/@52.218708,21.0164719,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x471ecce662197b7b:0xe91fac17380ead65!8m2!3d52.218708!4d21.0190468!16s%2Fg%2F1tf9l_v6?entry=ttu" target="_blank" ref="noopener noreferrer">Luna cinema</a>, 
localized in central Warsaw ('Luna' means 'moon' in old Polish). It's difficult to assess the exact number of people, but my initial estimates based on occupied seats in the cinema put that number around 250. By the way, you could feel the retro atmosphere of the cinema even before entering.
Just take a look below.

The agenda was strictly defined and available on the official [conference website](https://kongresnextjs.pl/). Additionally, each participant received a badge 
with the agenda, including their name. Considering name of the conference you might have expected news about Next.js, but in reality, the scope of topics was 
much broader, covering Angular, Astro, and several other technologies. Below reverse of my badge:

From my perspective, I was most interested in topics related to Next.js and Astro.
