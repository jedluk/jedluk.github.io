If you were born in the 90s or earlier, you know that Mario is a timeless classic. In this episode I'll show you 
how to recreate your childhood years at a common sense cost.

A few weeks ago, I was considering what I could buy with the Amazon voucher I received as a gift. For a long time, I was thinking about a Chicago Bulls jacket, but then I had an epiphany - I don't have a Raspberry Pi yet (back in my student days, I had an Arduino, but I can't locate it now). First and foremost, I wanted to complete a specific programming project (which is currently in progress - I may share more about it in the future, but for now, it's confidential ðŸ˜Ž).When the Raspberry Pi package arrived, I started looking for additional accessories and stumbled upon the [botland](https://botland.com.pl) store. I was particularly interested in getting a case and something for cooling. But when I was browsing the available accessories, I came across gamepads ðŸ˜¯.
It caught my attention, and I started browsing GitHub projects related to Raspberry Pi. Finally I landed at [retropie](https://retropie.org.uk/). Great shoot ! At that point, I already knew I had to put together my gaming setup. Below, you'll find a list of purchases needed to set up a gaming station, and for simplicity's sake, I will provide prices in dollars (based on the exchange rate from November 5, 2023). 
<ul>
    <li>raspberry Pi 4B 4GB RAM, <a href="https://botland.com.pl/moduly-i-zestawy-raspberry-pi-4b/14647-raspberry-pi-4-model-b-wifi-dualband-bluetooth-4gb-ram-15ghz-5056561800349.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">botland</a>, <strong>$74.27</strong></li>

    <li>SNES gaming pad, <a href="https://botland.com.pl/kontrolery-do-gier-usb/12458-snes-retro-kontroler-do-gier-kolorowe-przyciski-5904422319311.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">botland</a>, <strong>$4.25</strong></li>
    <li>microSD Card (32GB), <a href="https://botland.com.pl/karty-pamieci-microsd-sd/6946-goodram-all-in-one-m1a4-karta-pamieci-microsd-32gb-100-mb-s-klasa-10-adapter-czytnik-otg-5908267930274.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">botland</a>, <strong>$5.02</strong></li>
</ul>

This adds up to <strong>$109.63</strong>. The first thing after assembling the kit is to install the operating system on the SD card, and for this purpose, I use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). After opening click on <i>Choose OS</i> -> <i>Emulation and game OS</i> -> <i>RetroPie</i> -> <i>RetroPie 4.8 (RPI 1/Zero) </i> (or whatever version of Raspberry you possess). From storage choose SD Card which is plugged into your computer. Click <i>Write</i> and wait for awhile. Now you can connect raspberry with you monitor via HDMI and connect the power. After awhile you should see RetroPie splash screen.

By default RetroPie does not include any games. We have to manually install them with help of some ROM providers, like [hustler](https://romhustler.org/). There are couple of ways of installing them , I will show you simplest one.
