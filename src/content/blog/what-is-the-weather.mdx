Today I'll show you how in few simple steps build low resolution (0.25 degree) global temperature map, similar to 
[Ventusky](https://www.ventusky.com/) is offering. I'll use data provided by - [National Oceanic and 
Atmosfpheric Admistation](https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/), which is common source in case of similar visualizations.

When comes to global temperature map first thing we should talk about is so called resolution. It determines the 
number of nodal points for which the value of the interpolated parameter is assigned. To clarify what I'm talking
about take a look on image below.

</div>

Vertical lines represents meridians, horizontal lines - parallels, dots - nodal points. In such case (please note numbers 
assigned) resolution is equal 0.25 degree. Another commonly used resolutions are 0.5 degree and 1 degree (please note that smaller 
resolution results in better quality). Knowing that 1Â° of latitude is equal around 111 kilometers we can easily calculate that in 
model will be calculate each 27.8 km. You might argue that it is high already resolution, but nowdays we can easily observe that temperature
across one city might vary by several Celsius degrees, therefore I would be reserved with such judgments.
