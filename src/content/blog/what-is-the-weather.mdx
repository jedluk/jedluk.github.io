Today I'll show you how in few simple steps build global temperature map, similar to 
[Ventusky](https://www.ventusky.com/) is offering. I'll use data provided by - [National Oceanic and 
Atmosfpheric Admistation](https://www.weather.gov/), which is common source in case of similar visualizations.

When comes to global temperature map first thing we should talk about is so called resolution. It determines the 
number of nodal points for which the value of the interpolated parameter is assigned. To clarify what I'm talking
about take a look on image below.

<div class="flex justify-center [&>img]:w-[200px] md:[&>img]:w-[400px]">
    <img src="/blog/images/grid.png" alt="grid" />
</div>

Vertical lines represents meridians, horizontal lines - parallels, dots - nodal points. In such case (please note numbers 
assigned) resolution is equal 0.25 degree. Another commonly used resolutions are 0.5 degree and 1 degree (please note that smaller 
resolution results in more accurate model). Knowing that 1Â° of latitude is equal around 111 kilometers we can easily calculate that in case of 
abovementioned grid, nodes are approximately 28 km away. You might argue that it is high resolution already, but nowdays we can easily observe 
that temperature across one city might vary by several Celsius degrees, therefore I would be reserved with such judgments. Let's choose 0.25 
degree for this tutorial.

I'm visiting [NOAA GFS page](https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/filter_gfs_0p25.pl) (GFS stands for <i>Global Forecasting System</i>), all other 
models and resolutions are availabe [here](https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/). You should see there 10 subdirectories (state for Nov 21, 2023), 
for the last 10 days. They release forecasts each 6 hours, starting from midnight - inside selected day directory you should find another subfolders named 
after hours: <i>00, 06, 12, 18</i>. Keep in mind it's UTC time (aligned with meridian 0Â°), not your local one. The new forecasts appears typically dozen of minutes
after corresponding time (this is the case with today's data, for previous days you should see always all 4 folders). In next page you have to choose 
<i>atmos</i> subdir (probably it's shorcut for atmoshpheric). Now you should finally see GRIB (<i>General Regularly-distributed Information in Binary form</i>) 
filter configuration

<img src="/blog/images/gfs_setup.png" alt="GFS setup" />

Starting from top of the page you can select one of files: <i>*.anl, *.f000, *.f001, *.f002, ..., *.f384</i>. ANL file refers to an analysis file. 
The analysis represents the initial state of the atmosphere at the beginning of a model run. On the other hand, the <i>f000, f001, f002</i> etc., represent forecast hours. 
These files contain the model's predictions for different hours into the future, starting from the initial analysis time (in such case f000 means model prediction for now, last one - 
 f384 - 16 days from now). I'm selecting current hour (.f000)

Next you can select model options. I haven't deciphered all the possible options yet, but I think description is quite straightforward. In case of global temperature map 
following parameters are needed:

<ul>
    <li> level desired: 2m above ground (this is what we as humans feel)</li>
    <li> variables desired: TMP (temperature) </li>
    <li> subregion: left longitude: -180Â°, right longitude: 180Â°, top latitude: 90Â°, bottom latitude: -90Â° (entire world)</li>
</ul>

At the bottom of the page we check <i>Show the URL only for web programming</i> and click <i>Start download</i>. We'll be
redirected to a page which shows a link to direct download. I'm copying the link since I preffer to encapsulate entire process
in bash script.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

day=$(date -u '+%Y%m%d') # use UTC time
current_hour=$(date -u +'%H')

if [ $current_hour -lt 6 ]; then
    rounded_hour="00"
elif [ $current_hour -lt 12 ]; then
    rounded_hour="06"
elif [ $current_hour -lt 18 ]; then
    rounded_hour="12"
else
    rounded_hour="18"
fi

BASE_URL="https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/filter_gfs_0p25.pl"
DIR="dir=%2Fgfs.${day}%2F${rounded_hour}%2Fatmos"
FILE="file=gfs.t${rounded_hour}z.pgrb2.0p25.f000"
VAR="var_TMP=on"
LEVEL="lev_2_m_above_ground=on"
REGION="subregion=&toplat=90&leftlon=-180&rightlon=180&bottomlat=-90"
URL="${BASE_URL}?${DIR}&${FILE}&${VAR}&${LEVEL}&${REGION}"
echo "\nDownloading data from noaa - ${URL}\n"
curl -L $URL -o temp.grib2
```

There is no magic here, just one thing to remember is to round current hour into hours predefined by NOAA: <i>00, 06, 12 or 18</i>. Also I'm defining 
each search parameter in the new line to make script more readable. Last but not least is to fetch data with cURL - I want to save file as <i>temp.grib2</i>. 
After getting data I want to process the file. For this reason we will need CLI tool called GDAL (<i>Geospatial Data Abstraction Library</i>) - translator library 
for raster and vector geospatial data formats. On MacOS it can be downloaded with [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gdal#default). For other operating 
systems download instruction can be found [here](https://gdal.org/download.html). Once installed I'm checking file with <i>gdalinfo</i> command.

```sh

We can see couple important informations here. First of all image size is 1440 x 721 pixels. It is saved on 1 band, using Float64. In metadata section we can see that 
Celsius is used as a temperature unit. That's enough I have to know. I'm adding 2 new lines to my script now:

```sh
gdal_translate -of GTiff -sds -a_srs EPSG:4326 temp.grib2 temp.tif
gdaldem color-relief temp.tif palette_celsius.txt temp_color.tif -alpha          
```

<i>gdal_translate</i> does exactly thing as it says - converts raster between 2 different formats. By adding <i>a_srs</i> argument we change projection into EPSG:4326. 
As an output we get TIFF image. Second command converts grayscale image into colorful image using  `palette_celsius.txt`. This simple file contains 4 columns:
temperature value (in Celsius) as well as three color components R, G, B associated with this value. In each next row we define color for different value in ascending order.
I'm borrowing colors and thresholds from ventusky website. Entire file content you can see below.

```txt
-40 238 238 238
-30 255 170 255
-20 145 9 145
-15 36 24 106
-10 85 78 177
-5 62 121 198
0 75 182 152
5 89 208 73
10 190 228 61
15 235 215 53
20 234 164 62
25 229 109 83
30 190 48 102
40 107 21 39
50 43  0  1
```
If you get lost somwhere around the road, you can see entire bash script [here](/blog/assets/gen_temp_map.sh). Keep in my mind 
that in corner case which I did not cover, script will not generate image cause NOAA folder does not exist yet (folders are not 
created punctually at the times they are named). In such case you can manually overwrite hour with previous one. I'm running the script and open the image. Now I know what is the weather ðŸ˜….

Pretty cool as for couple of bash commands don't you think ? Just to make things clear typically RGB image is not send to the frontend application.
Usually app fetches grayscale image, then it's drawn on a canvas using webgl shaders, where color pallete is applied. But the script I've prepared 
is perfect for home made visualizations. That's all what I've prepared for today. I hope next time you'll think about the weather You just run the script.
See you soon!
