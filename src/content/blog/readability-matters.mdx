Hi there ! Today I was reading some code I have wrtitten around 3 years ago (ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…) and I had an epiphany. 
Thus I want to share with you my reflection on code readability.

Consider function below (for the purpose of article I've modified the original function I found today):
```js
function isDoable(dish) {
  return ![
    'squid in batter',
    'pork goulash with potatoes',
    'dumplings with cabbage and mushrooms',
    'pork chop with rice'
  ].includes(dish)
}
```

I think it's pretty straightforward. It returns true while dish is on the predefined list. But wait ... 
Actually it returns false in this case ! It's all because negation sign before the array ... While the array 
has many elements it is difficult to pay attention to this small detail. I think in such scenario we can sacrifice simplest solution 
to gain readability. Eventually we don't expect that final solution will increase complexity of the function drastically. Let's try refactor a bit. 

```js
function isDoable(dish) {
  const isOnList = [
    'squid in batter',
    'pork goulash with potatoes',
    'dumplings with cabbage and mushrooms',
    'pork chop with rice'
  ].includes(dish)
  return !isOnList
}
```

Now it's clear that we are looking for a dish which is not on the list, but it requires one more variable to introduce. Hmmm. Maybe ternary operator ?
```js
function isDoable(dish) {
  return [
    'squid in batter',
    'pork goulash with potatoes',
    'dumplings with cabbage and mushrooms',
    'pork chop with rice'
  ].includes(dish) ? false : true
}
```
Looks unnatural as includes itself return boolean value. Maybe we can borrow the approach from react ? Do you remember how you can render components 
under certain conditions ? We can use <strong>ampersand operator (&&)</strong>
```js
function isDoable(dish) {
  return [
    'squid in batter',
    'pork goulash with potatoes',
    'dumplings with cabbage and mushrooms',
    'pork chop with rice'
  ].includes(dish) && false
}
```

Perfect ! This reflects the programmer's intentions in a very nice way. We can translate it into humand words into: <i> if first thing is true, return the second</i> (which is false in our case).
