<p class="text-justify">If you've ever worked on an analytical dashboard or just a system dealing with standardized data, probably you know already that export 
from such a systems is one of the fundamental features. In this post I will show you how you can implement CSV export in React-based 
applications without any effort.</p>

<strong>Comma-separated values (CSV)</strong> is text file format which usually uses commas to separate values (it sounds ridiculous but I've seen many times semicolon as delimiter even that format name is self explanatory).

import ExportCSV from '../../components/blog-samples/ExportCSV.jsx';

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <button className="p-2 bg-lime-500 rounded-md text-white hover:scale-110 ease-in-out duration-300 hover:bg-lime-400">
        <ExportCSV client:only />
    </button>
</div>

If you've ever worked on an analytical dashboard or with various types of data that can be described in a standardized way, 
you know that exporting it from the system is one of the fundamental features. In this post, I will show you how you can easily export 
such data in CSV format in React-based applications.
