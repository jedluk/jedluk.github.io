If you've ever worked on an analytical dashboard or with various types of data that can be described in a standardized way, 
you know that exporting it from the system is one of the fundamental features. In this post, I will show you how you can easily export 
such data in CSV format in React-based applications.

<bold>Comma-separated values (CSV)</bold> is text file format which usually uses commas to separate values (It can sound ridiculous but I've seen many times semicolon as delimiter even that format name is self explanatory).

import ExportCSV from '../../components/blog-samples/ExportCSV.jsx';

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <button className="p-2 bg-lime-400 rounded-md text-white [&>a]:hover-text-white">
        <ExportCSV client:only />
    </button>
</div>


<div class="my-4 relative w-full h-[300px] rounded-xl border-slate-300 border-[1px]">
    <div class="absolute w-20 left-[calc(50%-40px)] top-[calc(50%-20px)] text-black text-4xl font-bold">.csv</div>
</div>
